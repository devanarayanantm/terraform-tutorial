secrets.tfvars: A Secure Way to Store Sensitive Information

In Terraform, secrets.tfvars is a file used to store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and access tokens, in a secure manner. This file is typically excluded from version control to protect sensitive data.

Why Use secrets.tfvars?

Security: By separating sensitive information from the main configuration files, you reduce the risk of accidentally exposing it.1 Â

Organization: It keeps your configuration clean and organized.
Flexibility: You can easily manage and update sensitive information without modifying the main configuration files.
How to Use secrets.tfvars:

Create the File:

Create a file named secrets.tfvars in your Terraform project directory.
Add Sensitive Information:

Add key-value pairs to the file, where the keys are variable names and the values are the sensitive information:
api_key = "your_api_key"
password = "your_password"
Reference Variables in Your Main Configuration:

Reference the variables defined in secrets.tfvars using the var function:
Terraform

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Reference the secret from secrets.tfvars
  key_name = var.key_name
}
Important Considerations:

Security Best Practices:
Avoid Committing secrets.tfvars to Version Control: This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.
Use Environment Variables: Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information, especially in CI/CD pipelines.
Utilize Terraform Cloud or Enterprise: These platforms offer secure ways to manage and store sensitive information.
Testing and Validation:
Implement thorough testing and validation procedures to ensure that your Terraform configurations work correctly with the sensitive information.
